# EDA Technologies with Weather Prediction

This repository showcases the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to predict weather patterns. We utilize data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning to gain insights into weather data and create a model for weather prediction. The project aims to demonstrate how EDA can be used as the foundation for building accurate forecasting systems.

# Project Overview
In this project, we explore various weather data sets, uncover trends, correlations, and patterns, and use the insights gained to predict future weather conditions. The end goal is to build a predictive model capable of forecasting future weather, using historical weather data.

# Technologies Used
- Python: Main programming language for data analysis and machine learning
- Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning
- NumPy: Numerical operations
- Matplotlib: Data visualization
- Seaborn: Advanced statistical data visualization
- Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive environment for code execution and visualization
- Statsmodels: Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing
  
## Features
- Data Collection: Collection of historical weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, etc.)
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualize trends in temperature, precipitation, humidity, etc.
- Identify correlations between weather features.
- Analyze seasonal and geographical patterns.
- Weather Forecasting: Predict future weather conditions based on historical data using models trained on EDA insights.
